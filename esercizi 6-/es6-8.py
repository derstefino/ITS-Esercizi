'''6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a different pet.
In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name.
Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and as
you do, print everything you know about each pet. '''
