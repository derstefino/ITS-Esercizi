'''3-3. Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples.
Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”'''

transport:list = ["ferry", "feet", "train"]

print(f"I'd fall asleep on a {transport[2]}, given enough time")

print(f"river crossed by {transport[0]}!")
